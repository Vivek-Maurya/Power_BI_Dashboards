## In this project, I used Microsoft Power BI to create an interactive sales dashboard for Atliq Hardware. The dashboard provided a visual representation of the company's sales data and allowed me to identify the company's top-performing products and regions where sales were highest. Additionally, I pointed out areas where the company was struggling, such as low sales in certain product categories and regions.

## By creating this dashboard, I was able to provide Atliq Hardware with valuable insights that can help them to improve their sales and overall business operations. Completing this project using Microsoft Power BI was a great learning experience, and I'm excited to see the impact my analysis will have on Atliq's future growth.
